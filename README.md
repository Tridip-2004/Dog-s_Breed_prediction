# 📌 Project Overview

Dog breed identification is a challenging computer vision task due to high inter-class similarity and variations in pose, lighting, and background.

This project leverages MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient CNN architecture, to build a scalable and accurate dog breed classifier.

# 🔹 Key Highlights

✅ 157 dog breed classes

✅ MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet

✅ Transfer learning + fine-tuning

✅ Streamlit web application

# 🧠 Model Architecture

Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Input Shape: (224 × 224 × 3)

Custom Classification Head:

Global Average Pooling

Dense (ReLU)

Dropout (regularization)

Dense Softmax output (157 classes)

# 🔧 Fine-Tuning Strategy

Initial layers frozen for feature extraction

Top layers unfrozen for fine-tuning

Lower learning rate for stable convergence

# 📂 Dataset

Image Type: RGB images

Preprocessing:

Resizing to 224×224

Normalization

Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom)

# 📌 Dataset organized using class-wise folders for training and validation.
